                    <h3>Guardians of the New Sky</h3>
                    <p class="service-tagline">A Cooperative Journey of Stewardship</p>
                    <p>
                        In this game, players co-create a new world not by becoming "more" in a heroic sense, but by
                        letting go of attachments and certainties. Humanity is revealed through vulnerability rather
                        than dominance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enlightenment is experienced as a release, not an acquisition. It is the <em>emptiness</em>
                        inside that makes the vessel useful. The game's mechanics require players to act as stewards of
                        something bigger than themselves, requiring them to drop the "trail of baggage" they've been
                        carrying.
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-mechanic">
                        <h4>The Hidden Quest</h4>
                        <p>
                            At the start, each player receives a secondary quest representing a call to
                            service—unglamorous,
                            invisible, but essential. Spaceholders are individuals whose calling is not to create big
                            structures or have a massive public impact,
                            but to embody presence in small, everyday tasks like gardening, handicrafts. Whoever comes
                            into contact with them enters the field of presence of the spaceholder.
                            Whatever happens to one affects the collective. True healing arises from shared presence.
                            The game's goal can thus be defined as everyone being present together,
                            at the same time. While the surface selves are different, humans can meet in a sense of
                            oneness at the level of depth.
                            Since the game is cooperative, it can only be won by working
                            together on both the visible, stated goals and the invisible acts of stewardship.

                    <p class="service-tagline">Political Frameworks Rooted in the Stars</p>
                    <p>
                        AstroPolitics is the research and development of political structures and frameworks that are
                        directly rooted in astrological principles. By grounding governance in the archetypal patterns
                        of the cosmos, we honor human needs and diversity at a fundamental level—in a way that no
                        previous political system or philosophy has been able to.
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-mechanic">
                        <h4>A New Foundation for Governance</h4>
                        <p>
                            Traditional political systems impose uniform structures on infinitely diverse populations.
                            AstroPolitics recognizes that each individual carries a unique archetypal blueprint—a natal
                            chart that maps their essential needs, drives, and potential contributions to the
                            collective.
                            By building political frameworks that acknowledge these fundamental differences, we create
                            systems where diversity is not merely tolerated but is the very foundation upon which
                            governance is built.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From resource allocation aligned with planetary cycles to conflict resolution informed by
                            synastry, AstroPolitics offers a paradigm shift: politics that serves the whole human being,
                            not just the ideological surface.
