                    <p>
                        In this game, players co-create a new world not by becoming "more" in a heroic sense, but by
                        letting go of attachments and certainties. Humanity is revealed through vulnerability rather
                        than dominance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enlightenment is experienced as a release, not an acquisition. It is the <em>emptiness</em>
                        inside that makes the vessel useful. The game's mechanics require players to act as stewards of
                        something bigger than themselves, requiring them to drop the "trail of baggage" they've been
                        carrying.

                        <h4>The Hidden Quest</h4>
                        <p>
                            At the start, each player receives a secondary quest representing a call to
                            service—unglamorous,
                            invisible, but essential. Spaceholders are individuals whose calling is not to create big
                            structures or have a massive public impact,
                            but to embody presence in small, everyday tasks like gardening, handicrafts. Whoever comes
                            into contact with them enters the field of presence of the spaceholder.
                            Whatever happens to one affects the collective. True healing arises from shared presence.
                            The game's goal can thus be defined as everyone being present together,
                            at the same time. While the surface selves are different, humans can meet in a sense of
                            oneness at the level of depth.
                            Since the game is cooperative, it can only be won by working
                            together on both the visible, stated goals and the invisible acts of stewardship.
